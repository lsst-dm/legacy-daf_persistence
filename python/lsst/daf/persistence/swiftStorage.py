    Requires that the following environment variables exist:
    SWIFT_USERNAME : string
        The username to use when authorizing the connection.
    SWIFT_PASSWORD : string
        The password to use when authorizing the connection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    uri : string
        A URI to connect to a swift storage location. The form of the URI is
        `swift://[URL without 'http://']/[Object API Version]/[tenant name (account)]/[container]`
        For example:
        `swift://nebula.ncsa.illinois.edu:5000/v2.0/lsst/my_container`

    Downloads blobs from storage to a file, and uses PosixStorage to load that
    file into an object. Handles to files are cached (this is effectively
    necessary for e.g. iterating over fits headers) by location in
    self.fileCache. If it turns out that this allows the temporary file
    directory to grow too large it may work to modify this to keep only the
    most recently accessed file, which would still support iterating over a
    single file's fits headers.
